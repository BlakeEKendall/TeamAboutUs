                        <p>Hello, I'm Blake Kendall. I am a student in the Eleven Fifty Academy's part-time .Net Software Development course. My background is originally in music performance, studying opera at Butler University and Indiana University, but a love for computers and technology has lead me to seek a new career change in the tech realm. Previously, I have worked for Lowe's as a ProServices/Contractor Sales associate, and most recently for Barnes & Noble as a Community Business Coordinator.</p> 
                        <p>I am an avid reader, delving into science-fiction and fantasy novels from authors such as Neil Gaiman, Joe Hill, N.K.Jemisin, Jim Butcher, and Patrick Rothfuss. I am also a (casual) gamer, enjoying the stories and worlds crafted in games including Minecraft, Alan Wake, Control, Diablo III, and Half-Life 2.</p>
